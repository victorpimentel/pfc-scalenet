\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:intro3}

Last chapter was focused in work done by others; this chapter brings light to the actual work done in this project, a new iteration on the \ida{PNAI}.
As the previous compilations were needed to understand the environment of this work, the following sections explain which additions were requested and developed.

User requirements are the first thing to clarify, extracted from the received from tutors and other \ida{T-Labs} members previously involved in the project.
This feedback was continually given as the project evolved, mostly for design concerns or when adding additional technologies, not for the implementation itself.

Later on, the system design is elucidated with diagrams that highlight the changes respect the base version, detailing the implementation process.
Furthermore, noteworthy hiccups found in the implementation process are specified using the resulting algorithms and solutions.
