\section{New Requirements} % (fold)
\label{sec:new_requirements}

There are new requirements that need to be satisfied within the redesigned \ida{PNAI} interface.
These requirements were extracted in several team meetings as the work advanced.
They could be divided into roughly three phases: a initial phase (a full redesign), a second phase (adding more functionality) and a third phase (implementing the mobile version).
