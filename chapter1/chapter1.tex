    & I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon ---sue me--- and since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself.\\
    & So most nights before I go to bed I will lay six strips of bacon out on my \emph{George Foreman} Grill.\\
    & Then I go to sleep.\\
    & When I wake up, I plug in the grill. I go back to sleep again.\\
    & Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.\\
    & It is delicious. It's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day.\\
    & Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot. That's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that. \\
