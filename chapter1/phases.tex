\section{Project Phases} % (fold)
\label{sec:phases}

Since the beginning, the project had fairly unambitious objectives, so the timetable kept expanding based on feedback from the finished work.
According to the resulting development, the project can be structured in three phases, each of one taking a similar amount of time:

\begin{description}
  \item[Initial phase] To fulfill the original requirements, basically redesigning the \ida{PNAI} interface and adding some basic functionality relating the device list.
  In this phase all \idx{JavaScript} code was ported to \idx{MooTools} classes.
  \item[Intermediate phase] After that work was done, new requirements for the desktop version were added to implement more functionality into the \ida{PNAI} interface.
  Apart from creating a sidebar with the content list, the applet was replaced by the \ida{APE} server.
  This also includes fixing all kind of bugs with \idx{Internet Explorer}, working with the \ida{PHP} files and porting the existing \idx{Java} applet code to \idx{JavaScript}.
  \item[Final phase] The last goal in the project was creating the mobile version of the \ida{PNAI}.
  Also, this marks the transfer of the static files from the \ida{OSGi} bundle to the \ida{PHP} server.
