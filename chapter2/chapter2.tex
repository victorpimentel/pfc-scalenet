    & Well, technology is a glittering lure.\\
    & But there is a rare occasion when the public can be engaged on a level beyond flash ---if they have a sentimental bond with the product.\\
    & My first job I was in house at a fur company, with this old pro of a copywriter, a Greek, named Teddy. Teddy told me the most important idea in advertising is \emph{new}. It creates an itch. You simply put your product in there as a kind of calamine lotion.\\
    & He also talked about a deeper bond with a product: \emph{nostalgia}. It's delicate, but potent. Sweetheart.\\
    & \footnotesize{\emph{[starts slide show featuring photos of Draper's family.]}}\\
    & Teddy told me that in Greek, nostalgia literally means the pain from an old wound. It's a twinge in your heart, far more powerful than memory alone.\\
    & This device isn't a space ship, it's a time machine. It goes backwards, forwards. It takes us to a place where we ache to go again. It's not called a wheel, it's called a carousel.\\
    & It lets us travel the way a child travels. Round and a round, and back home again.\\
    & To a place where we know we are loved. \\
