\section{Client Programming Language: \idx{JavaScript}} % (fold)
\label{sec:javascript}

The only programming language available natively in browsers is \idx{JavaScript}, so any modern interactive web application should embrace it.
Given that the web has become such a popular platform and \idx{JavaScript} has a steep learning curve, the language is getting more attention lately and all indications point to a very bright future.
Most of the coding in this project was done in \idx{JavaScript}.
