As the Internet evolves, Web development tools mature and multiply at an incredibly fast pace.
In a few months the best choices becomes superseded by better and new tools.
If we are dealing with a rewrite that is something to take into account.

This chapter describes the technologies used for this project.
Since we are working on an existing system, most of them cannot be changed and are system constraints.
And since \idx{ScaleNet} includes so many different modules written in different languages and tools, it is wise to avoid adding even more layers of complexity.

A special case was the existing \idx{Java applet}.
Because of new requirements, an alternative had to be considered.
Eventually it was replaced by a new module called the \ac{APE} server\index{APE server}.
The other major addition to the system was the \idx{JavaScript} Framework called \idx{MooTools}.
Both decisions are explained and justified in \S\ref{sec:mootools} and  \S\ref{sec:ape}.
